# Stream your record player to your Google Cast-enabled devices!

This application will actually allow you to stream any arbitrary internet radio station.  It works with individual devices as well as Chromecast groups.

In this tutorial, I show you how to use your record player as the audio source (you'll need a Raspberry Pi and some other cheap hardware).

This idea, and much of my code, was adapted from the Vinyl Cast project by Allen Schober.

## Usage

Open the application, enter the full URL of the audio stream you intend to listen to, tap the cast button on the toolbar, and select your destination.
